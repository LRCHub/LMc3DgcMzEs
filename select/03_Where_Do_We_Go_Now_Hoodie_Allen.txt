(Hook)
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
And we can't go home now
We'll probably get thrown out
So where do we go now?
Where do we go now?

(Verse)
And I'm a product of my environment
That's why these people buy my music when I'm supplying it
You tell me life is always sunny, not ultraviolet
I feel like Bradley Cooper, tryna find me a silverlining
And I don't need a suit or a tie to keep me alive
I just need a good ass crew and a long ass drive, word
Keep it moving and keep improving the same time
People love but hate me, all in the same rhyme
Damn, that's just how it feel man
I ain't one of those rappers who got a deal man
Quit askin, every milestone you try to conquer – I passed it
Every album we dropped is a classic
That's the way we love to congregate the masses
Yo mama got a fatty, it's kinda hard to look past it
And I'm a educated bastard, rappin is how I'mma get my masters

(Hook)
So where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
And we can't go home now
We'll probably get thrown out
So where do we go now?
Where do we go now?

(Verse)
And I never think I'll be a hero
Growing up with my dad and learning from Al Pacino
Jets full, middle finger to all you damn Arinos
I'm living in a movie and feeling like Tarantino
Corleone, I'm tryna get my De Niro
Worked some long nights and now I need a cappuccino
All falls down when you live in a casino
And I'm just tryna add some motherfuckin 0's
So point to Pelegrino, shouts to it's the Bino
Shouts to printing rules, I didn't know where we would be oh
That thing, getting dinner in Connecticut
Talkin bout all these rappers, we hate it and getting mad as shit
Ha ha, like those were the days
We were living off the feeling, it was going our way
I know that life changes fast,
But I'd rather freeze the moment than go back and live the past

(Hook)
So where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
And we can't go home now
We'll probably get thrown out
So where do we go now?
Where do we go now?

(Verse)
I ain't tryna front and tell you it's all confidence
I'm just tryna capture the other rappers like condiments
'Cause I remember when we got no compliments
Opening up for Shawn was like my biggest accomplishment
I have my friends going nuts in the front
Actin like I'm the hottest shit until Pusher demolished it
One by one we created the following
I learned a lot in class but hated being the college kid
And when I graduated, labels started hollering
Worked through so much though, I needed a scholarship
Went to the bank, emptied what I deposited
And put it into one mixtape, I'm so positive
I'll never make one mistake, I'm so confident
There he go again, rappin, it's all opposites
I don't even care if I'll make it to the top
And shit 'cause I'mma keep livin and shouts to Jesse Costopolous
I said I'mma keep livin and shouts to Jesse Costopolous
Full house in it, full house in it yea

(Hook)
So where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
And we can't go home now
We'll probably get thrown out
So where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
