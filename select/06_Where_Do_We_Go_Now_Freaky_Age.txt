Remember the times when everyone cried,
Till I sat up and told a joke; they'd laugh
Remember the nights we couldn't get home,
Cause I got caught in fights, even then we laughed.
We kept it minded in the end, we'd make it home,
We'd have it all this great.
Remember times when everyone changed,
And in the end even you will change your way.

Remember times when everyone cried,
Till I stood up and told a joke
They'd laugh
Remember nights we couldn't get home,
Cause I got caught in fights
Even then we laughed.
We kept it mind that in the end
We'd make it home
We'd have it all
It's great
Remember times when everyone changed
And in the end even you will change your way

Remember times when everyone cried
Till i stood up and told a joke
They'd laugh
Remember nights we couldn't get home,
Cause I got caught in fights
Even then we laughed.
We kept it mind that in the end
People like us always stay thesame

Wanted to drive home on a saturday night,
Now we couldn't go home
It didn't feel so right.
