Where do we go?
When we die
Where do we go?

I have no answers
To these questions
Buried deep inside

Up and down
And over round and
I can't tell wrong from right

Where do we go?
When we die?
Where do we go?
When we die?
Where do we go?
When we die?
Where do we go?
When we die?

Am I wasting
Precious moments
With the ones I love

Do they know me?
Are they on me?
And I hope enough

Where do we go?
When we die?
Where do we go?
When we die?
Where do we go?
When we die?
Where do we go?
When we die?

Bring the heaven down
Tie it to the ground
So I can look around

Where do we go?
When we die?
Where do we go?
When we die?
Where do we go?
When we die?
Where do we go?
When we die?
